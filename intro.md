# 🌐 Introduction to BCG X & PowerCo Churn Project

---

## 🚀 About BCG X
**BCG X** is the tech build and design unit of Boston Consulting Group, where teams combine cutting-edge technology, data science, and human-centered design to deliver real business impact.  
As a Junior Data Scientist in this simulation, the goal was to solve a **customer churn challenge** for PowerCo, applying the same methods BCG X uses with real clients.

## 🏢 Client: PowerCo
**PowerCo** is a major gas and electricity utility serving SMEs.  
The company faced a growing problem of **customer churn**, driven by:  
- Increased competition from new energy providers.  
- Greater customer sensitivity to price changes.  
- Shifting demand and market uncertainty.  

PowerCo engaged BCG X to investigate churn drivers and recommend actionable solutions.
