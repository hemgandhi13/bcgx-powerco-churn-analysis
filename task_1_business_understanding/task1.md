# üìù Task 1 ‚Äì Business Understanding & Problem Framing

---

## üìå Task Overview
In this stage of the project, the focus was on **understanding the business context** and **framing the churn problem** for PowerCo.  

üîπ **What I Learned**
- How to interpret the client‚Äôs business context and concerns  
- The importance of breaking down the problem before beginning analysis  
- Key responsibilities of a Data Scientist at BCG X: framing, EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and communication  

üîπ **What I Did**
- Determined the **client data requirements** for investigating churn  
- Outlined the **analytical techniques** to be applied  
- Drafted a **professional email** to summarize the approach

## ‚ö° Client Brief
- **Client**: PowerCo ‚Äì a major gas and electricity utility serving SMEs  
- **Challenge**: High customer churn due to increasing competition, flexible pricing models, and renewable energy alternatives  
- **Key Hypothesis**: *Customers who are more sensitive to price are more likely to churn.*

## üìß Draft Email (My Submission)

**Subject:** PowerCo Churn Problem ‚Äì Data Requirements and Analysis Approach  

Hi,  

Estelle and I have started working on the PowerCo churn issue. Below is our initial outline covering the business understanding, data requirements, and proposed analytical techniques.  

### 1. Problem Statement  
We are investigating the factors contributing to customer churn, with a specific focus on price sensitivity. The core hypothesis we intend to test is:  

> ‚ÄúCustomers who are more sensitive to price changes are more likely to churn.‚Äù  

Understanding this will help PowerCo determine whether pricing strategy plays a significant role in retention.  

### 2. Data Requirements  
We would ideally request the following data from PowerCo:  
- Customer churn status (active or churned)  
- Historical energy usage and billing records (past 3‚Äì5 years)  
- Tariff/plan details and price changes over time  
- Customer demographics (region, customer type ‚Äì residential/commercial)  
- Customer satisfaction scores, NPS, or survey responses  
- Records of complaints or customer support interactions  

### 3. Proposed Analytical Techniques  
Once data is available, we plan to:  
- Use **correlation and regression analysis** to test price‚Äìchurn relationships  
- Create **visualizations** (e.g., churn rate by price brackets, heatmaps)  
- Apply **clustering** to segment customers by behavior and sensitivity  
- Build a **churn prediction model** (logistic regression, decision trees) to quantify impact  

Best regards,

## üìä Feedback from BCG X
The model answer emphasized:  
- Clearly defining **price sensitivity** and calculating it  
- Using **binary classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict churn  
- Selecting the **best model** using performance metrics and explainability  
- Quantifying **the extent to which price influences churn**  

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways
- Framing the problem upfront ensures alignment between business expectations and data analysis.  
- Identifying the **right data** early on prevents wasted effort later.  
- Price sensitivity is a strong hypothesis, but other factors (e.g., customer service, renewable options) may also be drivers.  
- Communicating approach in **business-friendly language** is just as important as technical detail.
